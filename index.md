# Welcome to my coding journey.

Here I will document my daily progress of trying to understand C# from a complete beginner standpoint. I currently only know HTML/CSS so this will be a big challenge for me but something I've always wanted to do.

My main goal is to eventually be able to code a game in Unity, however basic it may be. It may take months, it could take years but I will get there.

This blog (of sorts) is to help keep myself motivated and to also let others see my progress. I will also be posting updates on my [Twitter](www.twitter.com/_fwady).
